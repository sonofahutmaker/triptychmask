My mask was inspired by a dish I found on pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/356206651784216263/. I started with the idea of duality, and initially wanted to have a mask with a bunch of rotating faces that slotted into place kind of like this image: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/356206651784212373/. However, this proved difficult without switching to the WEBGL mode of Processing, so I redesigned to have the faces be layered. The inspiration for the background was also in line with this idea that there are a lot of factors controlling what face we see of a person, and a lot of factors that may be tethering them/their identity. So the lines that composes the background are tethered to the face, and the hands also have lines which are connected to the background also. The biggest thing I took from the costume people was to present an idea as well as the visual aesthetic; since I didn't have a time period or anything I needed to conform to like you would in a play, I was able to put the ideas first in a literal way.
